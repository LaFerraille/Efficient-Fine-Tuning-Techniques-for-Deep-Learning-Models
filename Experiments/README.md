In This Folder, we will have different sub-folders corresponding to the Different types of experiments.
Experiments to be Led are:
    - Dimension parameter influence (r in Lora)
    - Ablation Studies
    - Other Methods than Lora
    - Lora + 'Orthogonal methods', i.e prefix fixing or things like that
Comparisons will always be made between the result of a full fine tuning and the result of an experiment with different parameters and be recapped in a DataFrame.
